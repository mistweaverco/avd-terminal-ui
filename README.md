AVD Terminal UI
===============

[AVD (Android ü§ñ Virtual Device) Manager Terminal üñ•Ô∏è User Interface.

## Motivation

I don't use Android Studio for developing application code,
but I need to access the Android virtual devices frequently.

So it's annoying to have to either start them manually via the CLI or
having to open up Android Studio just to start some virtual devices.
